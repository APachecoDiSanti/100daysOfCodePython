# Notes

1. String indexing is done with brackets and an integer. e.g.: `"Hello"[1] => e`
2. Big numbers may use `_` to make them easier to read by humans. e.g.: `123_456_789` instead of 123.456.678 or 123,456,789 as people from different countries do.
3. Booleans in Python have a capital first character. i.e: `True` and `False`
4. The function `type(object)` can be used to get what's the type of the object.
5. Some casting functions: `int()`, `str()` and `float()`.
6. Division between integers produces a `float` as result.
7. `**` is an exponent operator. e.g.: `2 ** 3 => 8`
8. Some operators have the same priority and when multiple operators with the same priority are in the same expression the left operator precedes the right one.
