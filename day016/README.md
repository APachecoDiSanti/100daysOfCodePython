# Notes
1. Class names use PascalCase
2. To construct an object of a class we need to call the class plus parenthesis (e.g.: `Turtle()`)
3. In Linux, you need to [install python-tk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25905540/importerror-no-module-named-tkinter). In Linux Mint, that's `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`. 
4. Attributes of an object are accessed through a `.` (e.g.: `car.speed`)
5. Methods of an object are also accessed through a `.` (e.g.: `car.drive()`)
6. Pypi is Python Package Index
7. A package is a bunch of modules packaged together
