# Notes:
1. `len()` is a built in function to get the length of an object, not only strings. [Documentation here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=len#len).
2. You may use `\n` at the end of the message string in `input(message)` so the cursor asking for input appears on the next line.
