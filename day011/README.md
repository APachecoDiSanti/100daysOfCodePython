# Notes
Blackjack rules
- Add up your cards until you get to 21
- If your cards are over 21 you loose!
- All cards between 2 and 10 hold their face value
- A Jack, Queen or King counts as 10 
- An Ace is either 1 or 11 points
- Only one card of the dealer is shown
- While we have less than 21 points we can ask for more cards
- If we go over 21 it's a bust
- When we don't want any more cards, the dealer reveals their card
- If we have the same number we have a draw
- If the dealer has more points than the player, the dealer wins
- If the dealer has less points than the player, the dealer must ask for another card
- We will use an "infinite" deck
