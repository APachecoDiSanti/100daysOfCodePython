# Notes
1. You can add type hints to function parameters with `parameter: type`.
2. Labels with a defined width will have their text to wrap around the edges.
3. You can declare variables to have a type and no value assigned initially and assign its value later.
4. In functions, you can define the return type with an `-> type:` after the parameter parenthesis.
