# Notes
1. It is possible to import everything from a module into the current file using `from module_name import *` but this is discouraged as you may call functions without knowing where they come from.
2. You can import a module into your file and use an alias to refer to it in this file using `import module as m`.
3. Tuples are represented by a list of items, separated by comma and delimited by parenthesis (e.g.: `(1, 2, 3)`)
4. The values of tuples can't be changed once set.
5. Functions that return tuples can return a comma separated list of items instead of using parenthesis for the tuple (e.g.: `return r, g, b`)
