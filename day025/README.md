# Notes
1. `csv` is the built-in Python library to handle CSV files
2. `pandas` is a Python library for data analysis
3. A CSV loaded with pandas is a DataFrame and each row is a Series
4. Pandas automatically adds the column names as attributes to the dataframe and can be accessed with dot notation
