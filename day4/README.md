# Notes
1. To create a module you can simply create a Python file name and in the other source file import that file name (no extension). e.g.: `my-module.py => import my-module`
2. List indexing can also be negative to start counting from the end of the list. e.g.: `list[-1]`
3. Assignment to an item of the list can be done with subindexing. e.g.: `states[1] = "Pencilvania"`
