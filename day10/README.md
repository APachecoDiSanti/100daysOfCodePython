# Notes
1. When a function uses `return` without returning a value, it's actually returning `None`.
2. Docstrings for a function a defined with a triple double quote (`"""`) comment immediately after the function declaration.
3. You may store the name of a function as the value of a key in a dictionary and then retrieve it to call that function.
