# Notes
1. Dictionaries can be defined like a list of key-values separated by commas. e.g.: `{key1: value1, key2: value2}`
2. You may get a dictionary value by subindexing with the key. e.g.: `dictionary[key]`
3. Assignment is also done by subindexing with the key. e.g: `dictionary[key] = value`
4. Looping over each item of a dictionary is actually looping over the keys of the dictionary.
