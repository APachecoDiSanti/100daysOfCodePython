<h1>The Best Movies According to Agustin</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Planet of the Apes</h3>
<p>A superb movie exploring what would happen in a society where humans are not the dominant race nor the only intelligent beings. The ending is spectacular.</p>

<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>It has perfect pacing and tension building until it reaches its conclusion.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>The start of a great adventure.</p>
